<p></p>
<p>My student email address is s3765963@rmit.edu.vn</p>
<p>I come from Viet Nam so I am Vietnamese. But I wish that one day I can have another nationality is English.\n
It is a dream and it does not cost any price so I just dream about.</p>
<p>Then, just a little bit about myself that I want to write down that is I am not an introvert.\n
 I am lazy whenever nothing can interest me to do but as soon as I like it, I spend all the time for it, days and nights.\n
I like playing badminton and soccer, but do not have time and partners to play with, I can be in any group and type of people.\n
 But most of the time, I am just alone because, I am out of money to join the game. </p>
